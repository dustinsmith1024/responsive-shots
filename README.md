# Responsive Shots

A simple application to emails screenshots of a website at different resolutions.

Used to run at http://responsiveshots.com. I have since removed it and just run it locally when needed. Feel free to run your own instance at any domain though.

Currently we only support 4 sizes:
* 1920x1080
* 1680x1050
* 768x1024
* 320x480

# Why?

I built as a learning project and because I needed a quick way to test out my projects on different resolutions.  It also works well for running a test after deploying a style or other code change.

# Future

I recently extracted this from a larger side project and want to a few things.

Short term:
* API for hitting this via basic curl commands
* More resolutions
* Custom resolutions

Long Term:
* Scheduled emails (hourly, daily, etc)
* Store to Google Drive
